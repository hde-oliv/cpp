# cpp

## What is it?
This is the solutions to the exercises of 42 C++ Piscine, the first time in the curriculum where we learn a new language and stop using C.  
Most of the exercises are to illustrate how object-oriented programming works, instead of delving too much into C++.

## About C++
C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. 
First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time.

**In this project, the C++ standard used is 99.**

**Succeeded with 90%**
